# This is set up in tandem with small_bathroom_lightswitch.
# There are two lights in the room which we want to always be on or off together.
# When the main bathroom light changes state, it commands the shower light to the same state
# The shower lightswitch doesn't control its own light. Instead it controls
# the main light which then by proxy controls the shower light.
# I hope this prevents any future bathroom raves.
